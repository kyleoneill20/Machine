This report describes my study into the factors that influence median gross household income across the 103 Electoral Divisions of County Carlow. I began by bringing together data from the 2016 Census,age distributions, occupations, education levels and other small area population statistics (SAPS),and combining it with 2019 figures on median household incomes (overall, short and long distance commuting), proportions of income from pensions and social welfare, and the share of employment across different economic sectors.
To ensure consistency, each dataset was aligned by the Electoral Division name (EDdesc), stripping away numeric codes and suffixes such as “, Co. Carlow.” Once merged, the resulting table featured 813 numeric attributes per ED, covering demographics, income sources and labour market composition. For modelling, I focused solely on numerical columns and set median gross household income as the target variable. Three complementary methods were applied:
First, I fitted a linear regression alongside a more flexible random forest regressor to estimate actual income values. The linear model performed poorly, yielding a negative R2 (–2.39), which means it was less accurate than using the average income for every area. In contrast, the random forest explained around 61% of the variance (R2 ≈ 0.61) and produced a much lower mean squared error, indicating far better predictive power.
Second, to sort areas into income brackets, I divided the incomes into four quartiles and trained both logistic regression and random forest classifiers. The logistic regression model correctly assigned roughly 58% of EDs to their quartile, well above the 25% chance level. The random forest classifier achieved about 39% accuracy, showing some ability to distinguish income bands but lagging behind the simpler method.
Third, I had decided to explore natural groupings without using income as a guide. A four cluster K Means partition on all numeric features (excluding the income itself) produced a silhouette score of approximately 0.28, revealing modestly cohesive clusters that reflect underlying socioeconomic similarities among groups of EDs.
Looking at which features drove the random forest regressor most strongly, one attribute stood out: the code labelled T10_4_ACCAM, which accounted for nearly 15% of the model’s decision splits. The next most important predictors ranged between 1.6% and 3.5% importance and included various occupational and demographic indicators, alongside commuter income and pension welfare shares.
In summary, My analysis shows that nonlinear models like random forests can capture complex interactions in small area data and reliably predict household income levels. Simple logistic regression remains highly effective for categorising areas into income groups. Clustering uncovers broad socioeconomic segments, although with some overlap. Future work might include cross validation to assess model stability, visualisations to illustrate relationships more vividly, and dimensionality reduction techniques,  such as principal component analysis or Lasso regression, to distil the most informative SAPS variables. Geographic factors, like distance to urban centres, could also enhance the models.
